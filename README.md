Sudoku Generator and sudoku game
This is a project that contains a sudoku board to be solved.

It was created for learning purposes and it has:
 - Three different modes (easy, medium and hard)
 - It has an extra task from our friends from Taco Bell, which consists in read a json file that has an incomplete sudoku and insert it in the board. Then validate if the incomplete or complete sudoku is valid.
 - Material design
 - Sudoku generator
 - Sudoku validator
 - It works from SDK 21 and above
 
It also can be improved by:
 - Adding a timer
 - Making a more complex logic for the three different game modes
 - Validating in multiple devices
